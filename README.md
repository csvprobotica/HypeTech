## Introduction

_The RoSGhost team is integrated by Nahomy Sclopis, Alex Gonzalez and Alexis Quintero, who represent Colegio San Vicente de Pa√∫l in this Future Engineers competition. The project consists of building and programming a robot using LEGO Inventor, designed to navigate a challenge course. This robot combines LEGO mechanical and electronic components with electronic controllers and sensors, allowing us to explore the fundamental concepts of engineering and programming._

## Mision
_Participating in the Future Engineers Competition for the first time is an exciting and enriching experience. We hope to learn deeply about the integration of mechanics and programming through the construction of our LEGO robot._

## Vision
_Beyond the competition, we are excited to tackle innovative challenges, interact with other teams passionate about engineering, and see our ideas take shape on the competition track._

## Challenges
_This challenge will allow us to apply theoretical concepts in a hands-on environment, develop critical problem-solving skills, and collaborate effectively as a team._

_The robot we will use for this challenge contains the following electronic components._

1. Lego inventor Hub and its rechargeable battery programmed in the MINDSTORMS app.
2. two medium lego motors, one for rolling and the other for turning.
3. two ultrasonic sensors for the detection of the walls.
4. a color sensor for detecting green and red objects.
